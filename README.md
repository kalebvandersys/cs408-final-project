# Final Project

## Project Spec

For my final project I am going to create a website for an apartment complex. It will have a reviews page, a comment page, a photos page, and a home page.
The homepage will present the apartment complex, have some basic information, and contain links for the other pages. The review page with display past costumer 
reviews, and allow the user to add reviews. The comment page will display comments, and allow the user to add comments. The photos page will simply show some 
pictures of the apartment complex and apartments themselves. The target audience is the general public, although there may be some functionality for the apartment 
residence. The data it will manage is reviews, photos, and comments. For stretch goals, I would say getting a way to sort the reviews. They could be sorted by 
level of stars, date created, or maybe date updated. Have the ability to edit comments would be another one. Maybe have some comment threads for residents and some 
for the general public. Adding the ability to add photos to the photos page would also be neat. Maybe a chatbot that can answer basic questions about the apartment 
complex would be pretty cool. Having a uniform menu bar for navigating the website would be impressive. Having rotating photos in the home page would be another 
possible addition. Having the program scale or have a mobile version would be awesome. Creating a way to select how many stars you want to leave on your review would
be another stretch goal. I also could have different sections on the review and photos page for different floor plans. This would allow discussion and displaying the 
different rooms the apartment complex has to offer. Another thing I could add is an application page. A user could select a specific apartment floor plan and apply for it
by filling out a form.

Here are some additional basic details. The home page would be were the user starts. They then can scroll through and see basic information like the address, phone 
number and property manager. The home page will also contain links to the other pages. The photos page will be a simple gallery of photos to let the user know what 
life looks like at this apartment complex. The comments page will have comments that have been posted by residents or past residents or people who have visited 
the location to discuss what they think of the place. The reviews page would display residents opinion of the apartments along with an out of five star rating. As I 
made the wireframe, I got some more ideas. I will try to have the comments appear inside of comment boxes/bubbles. I think the property manager should have a headshot
on the home page and maybe a little bio about themselves.
